# About the project
This was our first collaboration project at Masai School. We had to given to clone AJIO application within a week. AJIO is an Online shopping app and we
had never used this application so we divided the tasks layouts and backend in two parts because we're only two members in our team. 
We took 4 days to complete this application. At the end of the project we also optimized and removed all the warnings from the code as well as tested the whole application.
